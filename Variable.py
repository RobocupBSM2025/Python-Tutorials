There a couple a data types I have no expirence with in python,
and therefore do no feel qualified enough to explain it to you.
If you feel you understand these or feel that you can explain anything I have stated better / clearer

These types include :

  Dictionary
  Set
  Tuple ~
  Complex Number
  Frozenset
  Range
  Bytearray
  Memoryview
  NoneType

In addition I am not certain how the bool variable. Sorry if this was not the most helpful, python is not
